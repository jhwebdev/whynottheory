				What is the Why not theory?
			</div>
			<div class="expl">
				<p>Why not theory is a movement that we are trying to start wich consists in whenever someone asks you to do something always think why not before you say no, over the years I have realized that a simple yes can take you to a lot of different places or to do things that you would never think of.<br>
				A clear example is the guys of Yes Theory. Yes Theory is a company created by 4 guys that met in Toronto in 2016. They immediately began to be really good friends thanks to their unique thinking and their future goals. After a few months they decided to go live together in L.A where they started a youtube chanel. They upload two different tipe of videos, one of them is showing people how to seek discomfort by saying yes more often. The other kind of videos consist in meeting people in the street and trying to convince them to do crazy stuff like go ski diving, go with them to a epic Oscar party, go skinny dipping or even eat a donut with them. The only condition they have is that they have to say "YES". And when they do, they realize that a simple yes can bring you experiences and new friends you would never imagine.</p>
